# Meross IoT library for Node

A work-in-progress translation of [albertogeniola/MerossIot](https://github.com/albertogeniola/MerossIot) to JavaScript, for use with Homebridge.
This will eventually allow for [https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-meross](homebridge-plugins/homebridge-meross) to work without packet sniffing.

With thanks to [@albertogeniola](https://github.com/albertogeniola) for all his research into how these devices work.
