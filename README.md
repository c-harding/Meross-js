# Meross IoT library for Node

A work-in-progress translation of [albertogeniola/MerossIot](https://github.com/albertogeniola/MerossIot) to JavaScript, for use with Homebridge.
This will eventually allow for [https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-meross](homebridge-plugins/homebridge-meross) to work without packet sniffing.

With thanks to [@albertogeniola](https://github.com/albertogeniola) for all his research into how these devices work.

## Current status

The translation is being conducted in the translation branch.
A lot of work is still needed to get to fully working status.

I also don’t have a full test rig, so I won’t be able to fully check if everything works yet: I only have some switches and power sockets.
